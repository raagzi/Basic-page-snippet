# Basic-page-snippet

In this code snippet, we have a basic React component called App that represents the entire page. It includes the Navbar, Content, and Footer components, which are defined separately.

The Navbar component renders a basic navigation bar with a list of links. You can customize the links according to your specific requirements.

The Content component represents the main content of the page. In this example, it includes a heading and a paragraph. You can modify the content as needed for your application.

The Footer component renders a basic footer section. You can include your own copyright information or any additional details you want to display in the footer.

Remember to import and use the App component in your root file (e.g., index.js) to render it to the DOM.

Note: This code focuses on the structure and basic components of the page. You can further enhance and style the components using CSS or additional libraries as per your design preferences and requirements.
